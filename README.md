# Physical VLSI Design for ASIC
(Guided by Kunsal Ghosh)

## Objective

The VLSI Physical Design for ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) using RISC-V aims to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the physical design process for integrated circuits, specifically focusing on ASICs implemented with the RISC-V architecture. 

## Installation

For the bin file of gcc ubuntu riscv64 in the riscv_toolchain file enter into root privileges and export PATH. 
Restart the terminal.

## Course

### Day 1

### Introduction to RISC V

* Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) defines the programming interface between software and hardware. It specifies the instructions that a CPU can understand and execute, along with their formats, addressing modes, and behavior.  
*The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is a modern and open-source approach to designing processor architectures. It is characterized by its simplicity, modularity, and flexibility. RISC-V follows the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) philosophy, aiming to minimize the complexity of instructions and emphasize a streamlined execution pipeline. The ISA is designed with a modular structure, allowing for easy customization and extension to cater to various application domains.   
** In this course we will be using RISC V ISA and picorv32a.
