# Physical VLSI Design for ASIC
(Guided by Kunsal Ghosh)

## Objective

The VLSI Physical Design for ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) using RISC-V aims to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the physical design process for integrated circuits, specifically focusing on ASICs implemented with the RISC-V architecture.
